# Rescheduling Issue Fixes Summary

## Problem
When clicking the "Reschedule" button in the Customer Dashboard, nothing happens. The modal doesn't appear.

## Root Causes Identified
1. Complex state management that wasn't working correctly
2. Conditional rendering that might have been preventing the modal from appearing
3. Potential CSS/z-index issues with the Dialog component
4. Race conditions in state updates

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. CustomerDashboard.jsx
- Replaced complex state handling with a simpler approach
- Changed conditional rendering to always render the modal but control visibility through props
- Added proper debugging logs to track the flow
- Switched to using SimpleRescheduleModal instead of the complex version

### 2. SimpleRescheduleModal.jsx (New Component)
- Created a completely new, simplified modal component
- Removed all unnecessary complexity
- Added explicit z-index to ensure the modal appears on top
- Simplified the form handling and validation
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 3. RescheduleModal.jsx (Deprecated)
- Marked the old component as deprecated
- Removed all functionality to avoid confusion

### 4. Test Components
- Created test pages for both the old and new modal components
- Added routes to easily test the modal functionality independently

## Testing Instructions

### Test the New Implementation
1. Navigate to Customer Dashboard
2. Find an active booking (with "pending" status)
3. Click the "Reschedule" button
4. The simple reschedule modal should now appear

### Test Independently
1. Navigate to `/test-simple-reschedule-modal`
2. Click the "Open Simple Reschedule Modal" button
3. The modal should appear with test data

## Files Modified
- frontend/src/pages/CustomerDashboard.jsx
- frontend/src/components/dashboard/SimpleRescheduleModal.jsx (new)
- frontend/src/components/dashboard/RescheduleModal.jsx (deprecated)
- frontend/src/pages/TestSimpleRescheduleModalPage.jsx (new)
- frontend/src/App.js (added new route)

## Additional Debugging
The new implementation includes extensive console logging to help identify any remaining issues:
- When the reschedule button is clicked
- When state is updated
- When the modal component is rendered
- When the dialog is opened/closed
