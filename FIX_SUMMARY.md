# Rescheduling Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
When clicking the "Reschedule" button in the Customer Dashboard, nothing happens. The modal doesn't appear.

## Root Causes Found
1. State update timing issue - React state updates are asynchronous
2. Modal component not re-rendering properly when booking data changes
3. Conditional rendering logic in the modal that might prevent display

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. CustomerDashboard.jsx
- Added debugging logs to track function calls
- Used setTimeout to ensure proper state update sequence
- Added a key prop to the RescheduleModal to force re-rendering when booking changes

### 2. RescheduleModal.jsx
- Added debugging logs to track component rendering
- Improved conditional rendering logic
- Fixed the CircularProgress component name typo

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to Customer Dashboard
2. Find an active booking
3. Click the "Reschedule" button
4. The modal should now appear with booking details

## Additional Improvements
- Created a test page at /test-reschedule to verify modal functionality independently
- Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback
