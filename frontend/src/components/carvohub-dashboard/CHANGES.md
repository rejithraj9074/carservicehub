# Changes Made to CarvoHub Dashboard

## Navigation Bar Removal
- Removed the main navigation bar from the Customer Dashboard page after login
- The sidebar now provides all necessary navigation
- Updated App.js to conditionally render the navbar only when not on the customer dashboard

## Sidebar Improvements
- Removed the notifications item from the sidebar since notifications are handled in the header
- Kept only essential navigation items in the sidebar:
  - Dashboard
  - Active Mechanic Bookings
  - Car Wash Bookings
  - Car Accessories Store
  - Second-Hand Cars
  - Payments
  - Profile Settings
  - Logout

## Header Enhancements
- Kept the header bar in the Customer Dashboard with:
  - Mobile menu toggle
  - Notification bell icon
  - User avatar
- This provides a clean, consistent interface for logged-in users

## Component Structure
The dashboard now follows a clean structure:
```

├── Sidebar (navigation)
├── Header (notifications, user profile)
├── WelcomeBanner
├── ServiceShortcuts
├── StatsCards
├── ActiveBookings
├── AppointmentsTimeline
