# API Integration Changes for Car Management

## Problem
The car data wasn't visible in the car listing area after adding a new car because the form submission was only showing a success message but not actually sending the data to the backend API.

## Solution
Implemented proper API integration for both the modal dialog in CarListings and the separate AddCar page to ensure car data is properly submitted to the backend and visible in the listings.

## Changes Made

### 1. CarListings.jsx (Enhanced API Integration)
- Implemented proper FormData creation for multipart submission
- Added all required car fields to the FormData object
- Included seller information as nested fields
- Added image handling for multiple file uploads
- Used apiClient.postMultipart for proper API communication
- Ensured form reset after successful submission
- Maintained automatic table refresh to show new entries

### 2. AddCar.jsx (Enhanced API Integration)
- Implemented proper FormData creation for multipart submission
- Added all required car fields to the FormData object
- Included seller information as nested fields
- Added image handling for multiple file uploads
- Used apiClient.postMultipart for proper API communication
- Ensured form reset after successful submission
- Maintained navigation back to listings after successful submission

## API Endpoint Used
- POST /api/admin/cars - Create new car listing with multipart form data

## Data Structure
The FormData object now includes:
- title, brand, model, year, mileage, fuelType, transmission, price, description, condition
- seller[name], seller[email], seller[contact]
- images (multiple files)

## Benefits
1. **Proper Data Submission**: Car data is now properly sent to the backend
2. **Visible Listings**: New cars immediately appear in the listings table
3. **Image Support**: Multiple images can be uploaded with car listings
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages are displayed for failed submissions
5. **Success Feedback**: Users receive confirmation when cars are successfully added
6. **Consistent Experience**: Both modal and separate page approaches work identically

## Technical Details
- Uses FormData for multipart submission to handle file uploads
- Implements proper nested field structure for seller information
- Includes validation before submission
- Provides visual feedback through success/error messages
- Automatically refreshes the car listings table after successful submission

This implementation ensures that all car data is properly stored in the database and immediately visible in the car listings, resolving the issue where added cars weren't appearing in the listing area.
